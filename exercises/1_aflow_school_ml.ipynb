These types of interconnected cloud-based applications have the potential to further accelerate the adoption of machine learning methods into materials development.\n","\n","\n","### API structure\n","\n","\n","The AFLOW-ML API is structured around a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architecture, which allows resources to be accessed using HTTP request methods. Each resource is located at an **endpoint**, which is identified by a URL comprised of descriptive nouns.\n","\n","\n","Resources within the API are represented in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and are referred to as **objects**. Once at an endpoint, the user must specify how to interact with the object. This is referred to as an **action**, and is an HTTP request method. The API supports the two most common HTTP request methods, ```GET``` and ```POST```, where ```GET``` fetches an object and ```POST``` sends user defined data to the server. Therefore, users interact with the API by performing actions (```GET```, ```POST```) on endpoints (URLs) to retrieve objects (resources).\n","\n","#### Endpoints\n","\n","All endpoints are located at the base URL https://aflow.org/API/aflow-ml/ and are organized by the model and the returned object.\n","\n","| Action | Endpoint               |        Object          |\n","| ----  |:-----------------------:| ----------------------:|\n","| POST  | /plmf/prediction        | Task                   |\n","| POST  | /mfd/prediction         | Task                   |\n","| GET   | /prediction/result/{id} |   Status or prediction |\n","\n","In general, API usage involves uploading a material structure to a POST endpoint, {model}/prediction, and retrieving a prediction object from a GET endpoint, /prediction/result/{id}, as shown in the flowchart below:\n","\n","![AFLOW-ML workflow](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1seImUEYSDQ7Kn3GLhMIf9zAsZZjJVx3P)\n","\n","```POST``` endpoints are responsible for the submission of a material structure for a prediction. In their request body, the file keyword is required. It must contain a string representation of the material’s crystal structure, in POSCAR 5 format.\n","\n","Upon receiving a request, the response body returns a **task object** containing information about the submitted structure, which has the following format:\n","\n","```JavaScript\n","{\n","     \"id\": String,\n","     \"model\": String,\n","     \"results_endpoint\": String\n","}\n","```\n","\n","When a material is posted to the API, a prediction task is created and added to a queue. Each task is assigned an identifier, the id keyword, used to fetch the prediction object at the endpoint referenced in the results_endpoint keyword. This endpoint, /prediction/result/{id}, supports the ```GET``` method and requires the id as a path parameter. Depending on the status of the prediction task, the response body returns a status object or prediction object. \n","\n","```JavaScript\n","// status object \n","{\n","     \"status\": String,\n","     \"description\": String\n","}\n","```\n","\n","Prediction objects are returned depending on the targeted model. Currently we support two models: molar fraction descriptor (mfd) and property-labeled materials fragments (plmf).\n","\n","### ML models\n","\n","#### property-labeled materials fragments (plmf)\n","The plmf model represents each crystal structure as a colored graph, where the atomic vertices are decorated by the reference properties of the corresponding elemental species. Topological neighbors are determined using a Voronoi tessellation, and these nodes are connected to form the graph. The final feature vector for the ML model is obtained by partitioning the full graph into smaller subgraphs, termed fragments in analogy with the fragment-based descriptors used in cheminformatics. All plmf models are built with the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) method. Models for electronic and thermo-mechanical properties were trained on 26,674 and 2,829 materials entries from the AFLOW repository, respectively. All models are validated through Y-randomization (label scrambling) and fivefold cross validation, with coefficient of determination (r^2) values in excess of 0.9 for most quantities, while the mean average errors are 0.035 eV (electronic band gap), 8.68 GPa (bulk modulus), 10.6 GPa (shear modulus), 35.9 K (Debye temperature), 0.05 K_B/atom (heat capacity at constant pressure) and 0.04 K_B/atom (heat capacity at constant volume), and the root mean square errors are 0.51 eV (electronic band gap), 14.3 GPa (bulk modulus), 18.4 GPa (shear modulus), 57.0 K (Debye temperature), 0.09 K_b/atom (heat capacity at constant pressure) and 0.07 K_b/atom (heat capacity at constant volume).

The model is trained using a data set of 292 randomly selected compounds of the ICSD for which the vibrational properties are computed with DFT calculations. Pearson and Spearman correlations for k-fold cross-validation are in excess of 0.9 for all predicted properties, while the mean average errors are 13.2 meV/atom (vibrational free energy) and 0.037 meV/(atom K) (vibrational entropy) and the root mean square errors are 18.8 meV/atom (vibrational free energy) and 0.052 eV/(atom K) (vibrational entropy).
